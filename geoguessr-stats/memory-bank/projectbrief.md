# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Project Brief

This project is a web application designed to display statistics from GeoGuessr duels. It provides users with a dashboard to analyze their performance, view recent matches, and explore statistics aggregated by country. The application is built with Next.js and TypeScript, and it uses Leaflet to display an interactive map of the duel locations.
