# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

Awaiting next task. The previous focus was on improving the user experience of the "Vibe" page map, which is now complete.

## Completed Problem Details

-   **Vibe Page Map Interaction:** The middle-click functionality to pin Street View windows was not working reliably. The right-click and Escape key behaviors also needed refinement.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Re-implemented the pin action to use the `mousedown` event on each marker, checking for the middle mouse button. This proved more reliable than `auxclick`.
    -   Re-purposed the right-click on a marker to clear the active selection.
    -   Enhanced the 'Escape' key to clear all pinned windows in addition to the active selection.

## Next Steps

-   Ready for the next feature implementation or bug fix.
