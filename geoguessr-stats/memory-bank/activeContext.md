# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on refactoring the main dashboard layout to be more dynamic and user-friendly. This involves creating a two-panel layout for the map and details, and ensuring that the tables within these panels are scrollable and resize correctly with the viewport.

## Immediate Goals

*   Resolve the outstanding issues with the dynamic layout, specifically the page scrolling and table scrollability.
*   Achieve a state where the layout is fully responsive and works as expected on different screen sizes.

## Next Steps

Once the layout issues are resolved, the next steps will be to commit the changes and then move on to other improvements, such as adding new features or enhancing the existing ones.
