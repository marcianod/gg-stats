# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on establishing a baseline understanding of the existing codebase and architecture. The primary activity is to populate the `memory-bank` with comprehensive documentation to facilitate future development.

## Immediate Goals

*   Complete the initialization of the `memory-bank` by populating all relevant files.
*   Establish a clear set of workflow rules and coding conventions.

## Next Steps

Once the memory bank is fully initialized, the next steps will involve identifying areas for improvement in the existing codebase, such as enhancing performance, adding new features, or improving the user experience.
