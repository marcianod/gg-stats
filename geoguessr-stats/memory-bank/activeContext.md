# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving the user interface and experience. The main dashboard layout has been refactored to be more dynamic and user-friendly, with scrollable panels and sticky table headers. Recent work has focused on enhancing the data tables for better readability and usability.

## Immediate Goals

*   The recent table enhancements are complete, including fixing alignment issues, displaying full country names, adding a rounds column, and optimizing column widths to prevent overflow.
*   The next step is to gather feedback on these changes and identify any further areas for UI improvement.

## Next Steps

*   **Gather Feedback:** Collect user feedback on the new layout and UI.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Based on feedback, implement further UI enhancements, such as improved data visualizations or more intuitive controls.
*   **New Features:** Consider adding new features, such as more detailed statistical analysis or user-configurable settings.

## Future Ideas

*   **Country Vibe Check Feature:**
    *   When a country is selected on the map or in the table, display all individual round locations within that country as pins on the map.
    *   Each pin should be clickable, opening the Google Street View for that specific location.
    *   **Advanced Idea:** Create a script to automate opening these locations and taking screenshots to build a "vibe" collage for a country or region.
