# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

The "Vibe Check" page has been significantly enhanced to provide a more immersive and interactive experience. It now features a draggable and resizable window that displays an interactive Google Street View panorama for each location.

## Implemented Features

*   **Interactive Street View:** Replaced the static image popup with a fully interactive Google Street View panorama.
*   **Draggable & Resizable Window:** The Street View is displayed in a window that can be freely moved and resized. Its position and dimensions are saved and restored between sessions.
*   **Lockable Window:** The window's position and size can be locked to prevent accidental changes.
*   **Advanced Caching:** The 10 most recently viewed locations are cached, allowing for instant switching between them.
*   **Dynamic Marker Coloring:** The map markers are dynamically colored to visualize their status:
    *   **Active:** Bright red
    *   **Cached:** Fades from red to yellow
    *   **Default:** Blue
*   **Corrected Panorama Orientation:** The Street View panoramas now use the heading and pitch data from the user's duels for a more authentic viewing experience.
*   **Clean Map Interface:** The choropleth overlays have been adjusted to be transparent for countries with no data, providing a cleaner map while retaining functionality.

## Next Steps

*   **Gather Feedback:** Collect user feedback on the new "Vibe Check" page.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Based on feedback, implement further UI enhancements.
*   **New Features:** Consider adding new features, such as more detailed statistical analysis or user-configurable settings.
