# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

-   **Task:** Initialize the Memory Bank.
-   **Status:** In progress. The core files are being created and populated with initial content based on an analysis of the project.

## Recent Changes

-   Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core goals.
-   Created `productContext.md` to outline the problem the application solves.
-   Created `techContext.md` by analyzing `package.json` to document the technology stack.
-   Created `systemPatterns.md` by analyzing the file structure to document the architecture.

## Next Steps

-   Create `progress.md` to complete the initial set of Memory Bank files.
-   Begin using the Memory Bank to inform future development tasks.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   **Shadcn/ui:** The project uses the `shadcn/ui` pattern for its component library. This means new UI components should be added using the `shadcn/ui` CLI or by following its pattern of creating self-contained, customizable components.
-   **Data Source:** The application currently uses a static JSON file for data. Future work may involve replacing this with a live data source.
