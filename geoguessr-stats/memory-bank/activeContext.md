# GeoGuessr Stats Dashboard - Active Context

## Current Focus

The application has been significantly restructured to improve navigation and usability. The "All Rounds" table has been moved to a dedicated "Data Explorer" page, accessible via a new sidebar, creating a clear distinction between the main dashboard and the detailed data analysis view.

## Immediate Goals

*   The application has been refactored into a main dashboard and a separate data explorer.
*   The "All Rounds" table has been enhanced with pagination, an index column, and improved column headers.
*   The distance calculation has been corrected across the entire application.

## Next Steps

*   **Gather Feedback:** Collect user feedback on the new structure and the "Data Explorer" page.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Based on feedback, implement further UI enhancements, such as improved data visualizations or more intuitive controls.
*   **New Features:** Consider adding new features, such as more detailed statistical analysis or user-configurable settings.

## Future Ideas

*   **Country Vibe Check Feature:**
    *   When a country is selected on the map or in the table, display all individual round locations within that country as pins on the map.
    *   Each pin should be clickable, opening the Google Street View for that specific location.
    *   **Advanced Idea:** Create a script to automate opening these locations and taking screenshots to build a "vibe" collage for a country or region.
