# Product Context

## Problem Solved

GeoGuessr players lack a centralized and user-friendly platform to track their game statistics over time. While the game itself provides some basic data, it doesn't offer in-depth analysis or historical tracking, making it difficult for players to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in their gameplay.

## How It Works

The application will sync with a user's GeoGuessr data (initially via a JSON file) and present it in an intuitive and interactive dashboard. Users can filter their stats, view round-by-round breakdowns of matches, and see their guess locations on a world map.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Clarity:** Present complex data in a simple and understandable way.
-   **Interactivity:** Allow users to explore their data through filters, tabs, and interactive maps.
-   **Insightful:** Help users discover meaningful patterns in their gameplay.
