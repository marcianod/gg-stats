# Product Context

## Problem Solved

GeoGuessr players lack a centralized and user-friendly platform to track their game statistics over time. While the game itself provides some basic data, it doesn't offer in-depth analysis or historical tracking, making it difficult for players to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in their gameplay.

## How It Works

The application will sync with a user's GeoGuessr data (initially via a JSON file) and present it in an intuitive and interactive dashboard. Users can view their stats in sortable tables and see their guess locations on a world map.

A key feature is the dynamic query builder, which allows users to create complex filters to analyze their data. For example, a user could query for all losses on a specific map where their opponent's MMR was above a certain threshold. This elevates the application from a simple stat viewer to a powerful analysis tool.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Clarity:** Present complex data in a simple and understandable way.
-   **Interactivity:** Allow users to explore their data through filters, tabs, and interactive maps.
-   **Insightful:** Help users discover meaningful patterns in their gameplay.
