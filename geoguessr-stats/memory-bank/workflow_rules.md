# Workflow Rules

## Development and Committing Workflow

As a solo hobby project, the focus is on flexibility and ensuring stability before committing changes. The workflow is interactive.

1.  **Local Development & Testing:**
    *   I will make code changes and test them using the local development server (`npm run dev`).

2.  **Committing and Pushing:**
    *   **Upon your request**, I will stage, commit (with a descriptive message), and push the changes to the remote repository. I will not do this automatically.

## Coding Conventions

*   **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for all new code.
*   **ESLint:** Adhere to the ESLint rules defined in the project configuration.
*   **Component Naming:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MyComponent`).
*   **File Naming:** Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-component.tsx`).
*   **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
*   **Type Definitions:** Define clear and accurate types for all data structures.
