# Workflow Rules

## Committing and Pushing Changes

For any task that involves modifying files, the following workflow must be followed:

1.  **Implement Changes:** Complete the coding task by modifying the necessary files.
2.  **Propose Commit:** After the changes are made, present the modified files and a detailed commit message for review.
3.  **Seek Confirmation:** Explicitly ask for confirmation before proceeding with staging, committing, and pushing the changes.
4.  **Execute Git Commands:** Only after receiving approval, run the necessary `git` commands to commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
