# Workflow Rules

## Committing and Pushing Changes

For any task that involves modifying files, the following workflow must be followed:

1.  **Implement Changes:** Complete the coding task by modifying the necessary files.
2.  **Run Type Check:** After implementing the changes, run a type check to ensure there are no errors.
3.  **Automated Commit and Push:** Automatically generate a descriptive commit message, then stage, commit, and push the changes.

## Coding Conventions

*   **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for all new code.
*   **ESLint:** Adhere to the ESLint rules defined in the `.eslintrc.js` file.
*   **Component Naming:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MyComponent`).
*   **File Naming:** Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-component.tsx`).
*   **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
*   **Type Definitions:** Define clear and accurate types for all data structures.
