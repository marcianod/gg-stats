# Progress

## What Works

-   The application now has a fully functional stats dashboard that displays recent matches, country-specific stats, and match details.
-   All tables in the dashboard are sortable and feature sticky headers with scrollable bodies.
-   The layout is responsive and dynamically adjusts to the browser's viewport height.
-   A generic `SortableTable` component has been created, promoting code reuse and consistency.
-   The Memory Bank is established and actively being used to guide development.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Dynamic Query Builder:**
    -   Implement a Jira-style query builder to allow for complex, user-defined filtering of the data.
    -   Allow for chaining multiple filters with AND/OR logic.
-   **Data Synchronization:**
    -   In the future, replace the static JSON file with a more dynamic data source, possibly a direct API integration with GeoGuessr.

## Current Status

-   The core viewing functionality of the application is complete. The focus has now shifted to enhancing the application's analytical capabilities with the implementation of the dynamic query builder.

## Known Issues

-   There are no known issues at this time.
