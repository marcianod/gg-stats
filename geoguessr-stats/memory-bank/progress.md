# Progress

## What Works

-   The basic Next.js application structure is in place.
-   The core UI components from `shadcn/ui` are set up and ready to be used.
-   The application is capable of running in a development environment (`npm run dev`).
-   A data structure for GeoGuessr stats is defined and a sample data file (`geoguessr_stats.json`) exists.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Data Loading Logic:** Implement the logic to read and parse the `geoguessr_stats.json` file.
-   **Stats Dashboard UI:** Build the main dashboard component to display the key statistics.
-   **Match History Table:** Create the table component to display a detailed history of matches and rounds.
-   **Map Visualization:** Implement the interactive map to show guess locations.
-   **Data Synchronization:** In the future, replace the static JSON file with a more dynamic data source, possibly a direct API integration with GeoGuessr.

## Current Status

-   The project is in the early stages of development. The foundational structure is set up, but the main features have not yet been implemented.
-   The Memory Bank has just been initialized, which will provide a solid foundation for future development.

## Known Issues

-   There are no known issues at this time.
